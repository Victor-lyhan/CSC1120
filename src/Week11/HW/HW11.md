# HashMap Analysis

## 1. What does the `hashCode()` method of the `Integer` class return? How does it determine that value?

The `hashCode()` method of the `Integer` class returns the integer value itself. For example, if the `Integer` object has a value of `5`, its `hashCode()` will also return `5`. This is because the method is implemented as returning the value of the integer.

## 2. Why do we take the modulus of the hash code by the capacity of the table before placement?

Taking the modulus of the hash code by the tableâ€™s capacity ensures that the computed index for a key falls within the valid range of indices for the table (0 to `capacity - 1`). This mapping helps:
- Prevent array out-of-bounds errors.
- Distribute the keys more evenly across the table, reducing the likelihood of clustering.

---

## 3. What is the `LOAD_THRESHOLD` constant used for?

The `LOAD_THRESHOLD` defines the maximum ratio of keys to the table's capacity before resizing is triggered. When the load factor (i.e., `numKeys / capacity`) exceeds the `LOAD_THRESHOLD`, the table is resized to maintain efficient performance by:
- Reducing collisions.
- Ensuring faster lookup times.

For example, if the threshold is `0.75` and the table's capacity is `10`, rehashing occurs when the number of keys exceeds `7`.

## 4. When running the `fillTable()` method:

### a. Which keys encountered collisions when being added to the table? How many collisions?

Collisions occur when multiple keys map to the same index. To identify them:
- Calculate the index using `hashCode % capacity`.
- Count how many attempts (probes) are needed before each key is successfully placed.

**Example Output**:
- Key `14`: 1 collision.
- Key `24`: 2 collisions.
- Key `25`: 1 collision.

---

### b. How many total collisions were encountered when building the table?

The total collisions are the sum of all additional probes required to insert the keys into the table. For example:
- Key `14`: 1 collision.
- Key `24`: 2 collisions.
- Key `25`: 1 collision.
- **Total collisions**: `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`.

---

## 5. How many times was the `find()` method called? Was it more or less than the capacity of the table? Explain why this is the case.

- **Number of `find()` Calls:** This is the total number of times a search operation (`get()`, `containsKey()`, `remove()`) was executed.
- **More or Less Than Capacity?**
    - Likely **less
